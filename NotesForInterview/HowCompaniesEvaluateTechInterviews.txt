Evaluating everything you do as you try to solve problem
Don't worry about basic syntactical errors (e.g. using list.add instead of list.insert),
more concerned with logic errors plus super obvious things (e.g. getting '=' and '==' mixed up)

Communicate thought process - interviewer will find this very valuable
If you notice yourself being quiet in interview - step back and try and at least explain headline of thought process
E.g. "Currently thinking about how to optimise this part", "I'm thinking about this part because I'm pretty sure I can do it better"
Mumbling better than nothing - don't want interviewwer thinking you're stuck when you're not

TL;DR Interviewer is trying to work out what's going on in your head
