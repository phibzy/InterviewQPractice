Graph - Collection of nodes/connections
      - Can be directed or undirected
      - Possibilities to consider in interview: directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, isolated notes
      - Questions in interview: "How big graph? etc." - Reveals whether recursive approach would be acceptable


DFS: (Use a stack)
   - Usually recursive
   - Go deep into one node before asking neighbours
   - Need to have a visited flag so you don't have infinite loop
   - WORST CASE: First searched node has super deep path tree that never connects to destination
   - BEST CASE:  Destination lies all the way at other end of the graph in some deep hole

BFS: (Use a queue)
   - Search all adjacent nodes, then the next level of adjacent nodes
   - Check if neighbours are connected to destination, if they aren't put all their kids on the queue 

BFS generally better
